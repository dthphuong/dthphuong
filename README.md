### Hi, I'm Phuong â€“ a Technical Project Manager passionate about building smart, scalable solutions.

With years of experience at FPT Software, I lead complex projects in the Oil & Gas sector, focusing on clean architecture, large-scale APIs (NodeJS, MongoDB), and AI-powered applications. Iâ€™m passionate about digital transformation, R&D innovation, and helping teams grow with the right tools and mindset.

I also spent 5 years building an EdTech startup, where I combined technology and education to create impactful learning solutions â€” an experience that shaped my product-thinking and user-centered mindset.

Previously a university lecturer, I enjoy sharing knowledge and mentoring future tech talents. Let's connect and explore how we can drive innovation together.
